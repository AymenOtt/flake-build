## Objective

This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

- What are we doing and why?
- What problem will this solve?
- What are the goals and non-goals?

## Motivation

- Why this is a valuable problem to solve?
- What background information is needed to show how this design
  addresses the problem?
- Which users are affected by the problem?
- Why is it a problem?
- What data supports this?
- What related work exists?

## User Benefit

- How will users (or other contributors) benefit from this work?
- What would be the headline in the release notes or blog post?

## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If
you have multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better
separation of the idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there
are alternatives that you have eliminated, you should also list those
here, and explain why you believe your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure you’ve thought through and addressed the following
sections. If a section is not relevant to your specific proposal,
please explain why, e.g. your RFC addresses a convention or process,
not an API.

### Alternatives Considered

Make sure to discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal.

### Performance Implications

Describe there any expectations any (speed / memory) impact and how this can be confirmed.

### Dependencies

*NOTE: This is mostly appliccable to applications.*

- Dependencies: does this proposal add any new dependencies?
- Dependent projects: are there other areas of software components or
  things that this affects?
- How have you identified these dependencies and are you sure
  they are complete?
- If there are dependencies, how are you managing those changes?

### Engineering Impact

Describe all of these:

- Maintenance process and responsibilities
- Building aspects
- Testing strategies
- Visibility of the APIs/ABIs

### Compatibility

Take to the account the following:

- Ensure that the design conform to the backwards & forwards compatibility
- Impact of the proposal on interaction with other parts of the current Ecosystem
- What are distribution strategies and does it affects packaging

### User Impact

- Describe changes, related to the user experience.
- Migration strategies from the older workflow, if any.

## Detailed Design

Elaborate on details if they’re important to understanding the design,
but would make it hard to read the proposal section above.

## Questions and Discussion Topics

Seed this with open questions you require feedback on from the RFC process.
